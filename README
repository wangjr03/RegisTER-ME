1. Introduction
The RegisTER-ME is a tool to map the multi-mapping reads in ChIP-seq data to one of its possible mapping positions using the sequence information and the mapping of other reads. 


2. Required Modules
Python
R
scipy
numpy
pyfasta
MACS (should be added to PATH, can be run directly using 'macs + commands'. You can install MACS through conda: conda install -c auto macs)


3. Required files
The read mapping results of 2 replicates, must be in SAM format and contain both uniquely mapped reads and multimapping reads
Whole genome sequence file, must be in FASTA format.


4. Usage
To run the code, use the following command:
python  batch.py  --t1 first_input_sam  --t2 second_input_sam  --prefix output_path/output_name_prefix  --weight weight -codepath code_path  --ref_path genome_sequence_fasta_file --max_iter max_iteration --genome whole_genome_size



5. Output
prefix+'_reads': SAM format, the mapping position of uniquely-mapped reads and multimapping reads.



6. Command Line Arguments
--t1: the first input SAM file
--t2: the second input SAM file
--pre: the prefix of the output file, should include the output path and output name prefix
-a: in data filtering step, the total mismatches and insertions or deletions allowed, default = 2
--genome: the whole genome size. default is the human whole genome size
--pvalue: the p value used to remove PCR duplications
--gap: the gap size allowed between 2 consecutive tags to form a site, default = 1
--weight: the weight for a multi-mapping reads
--ref_path: reference genome file, must include the path to the file and the file name
--codepath: the path of GibbsCode
--flanking: the sequence length up/downstream of the central pointer of a site, which is used to calculate kmer frequency. Totally 2f bp sequence would be used then',default= 0.5site
--threshold: the threshold for the fraction of changes between 2 Gibbs iterations, default = 0.01
--fraction: the threshold for the fraction of changes of the changes between 2 Gibbs iterations, default = 0.1
--max_iter: the max number of iterations in Gibbs sampling, default = 10
--num_bin: the number of bins to grid the prior, default = 100
